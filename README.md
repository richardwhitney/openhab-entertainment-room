# OpenHAB Entertainment Room
#### Student Name: *Richard Whitney*   Student ID: *20040645*

The aim of this project is to connect and control a number of devices from different vendors
in a single platform, independent of manufacturer and protocol. The entertainment room devices will
consist of the following: Samsung smart TV, LG soundbar, Sony PlayStation 4, Google Chromecast, Raspberry Pi,
and a Phillips Hue lightbulb.   
I plan to achieve this using openHAB, an open source home automation platform.
openHAB supports hundreds of technologies, systems and devices. It has an engine to design rules, with
time and event-based triggers. I will deploy an openHAB server on a Raspberry Pi and interact with the devices using a 
web and mobile client. The Raspberry Pi will also store persistent data on room temperature, pressure and humidity through the 
use of a SenseHat. The ultimate goal for this project would be to add voice control for devices with the use of an Amazon
Echo.   
The use of openHAB should allow this project to be scalable. Its REST API allows most aspects of the openHAB system
to be accessible by other programs. It can act as an MQTT client so useful data, e.g. room temperature, brightness of a
lightbulb, can be sent to an MQTT broker.
